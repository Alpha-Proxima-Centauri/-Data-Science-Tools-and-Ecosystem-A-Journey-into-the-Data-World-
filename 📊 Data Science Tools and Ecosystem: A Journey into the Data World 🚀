## 🔢 **Evaluating Arithmetic Expressions in Python** 🧮

Let’s dive into some simple Python examples to evaluate arithmetic expressions. Here are a couple of examples:

1. **Multiplying and Adding Integers**:  
   ```python
   (3 * 4) + 5
   ```
   Output: `17`

2. **Converting Minutes to Hours**:  
   ```python
   200 / 60
   ```
   Output: `3.33` hours
