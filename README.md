# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

## Introduction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that summarizes various tools and components of the Data Science ecosystem. The notebook highlights the popular programming languages, commonly used libraries, and essential tools that Data Scientists rely on for their work.

## Popular Languages in Data Science

Data Scientists use a range of programming languages to analyze data and build predictive models. Some of the most widely used languages include:

- **Python 🐍**
- **R 📊**
- **Julia 🚀**
- **Java ☕**
- **SQL (Structured Query Language) 🗄️**
- **JavaScript 🌐**
- **Scala 🚀**
- **C/C++ 🛠️**
- **Swift 🍎**
- **Go (Golang) 🚅**
- **MATLAB 🔢**
- **SAS 📊**

## Commonly Used Libraries

To handle data, visualize trends, and develop machine learning models, Data Scientists often utilize specific libraries. Some of the most commonly used libraries are:

- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Keras**
- **TensorFlow**
- **PyTorch**
- **Apache Spark**
- **ggplot2**

## Essential Data Science Tools

Data Scientists rely on various tools to create and manage data science projects. Some of these tools include:

- **Anaconda**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **RStudio**
- **Spyder**
- **Apache Zeppelin**

## Examples of Python Arithmetic Expressions

The notebook also includes examples of basic arithmetic operations in Python:

1. **Multiplying and Adding Integers**
   ```python
   # This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
   (3 * 4) + 5
Result:
17

2. **Converting Minutes to Hours**
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
```python
200 / 60
Result:
3.3333333333333335

# Objectives
# The main objectives of this notebook are :

1. To list popular languages used in Data Science.
2. To highlight commonly used libraries in Data Science.
3. To demonstrate the creation and sharing of a Jupyter Notebook.
4. To evaluate simple arithmetic expressions in Python.
